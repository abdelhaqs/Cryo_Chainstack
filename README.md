# ETL Pipeline for Blockchain Data

## 1. Data Transformation

Once the data is extracted, the next step is to transform it. This involves cleaning and structuring the data to make it suitable for analysis and storage. Python's powerful data manipulation libraries, such as Pandas, will be employed to handle this transformation process. This ensures that the data is in a consistent and usable format when loaded into the PostgreSQL database.

## 2. Architecture

Below is the architecture of the Cryo_Chainstack project:

## 3. Data Loading

The transformed data is then loaded into a PostgreSQL database. PostgreSQL is a robust and scalable relational database that is well-suited for storing large volumes of blockchain data. This setup allows for efficient querying and analysis of the data, providing a solid foundation for subsequent reporting and visualization tasks.

## 4. Workflow Orchestration with Apache Airflow

Apache Airflow will be used to orchestrate the entire ETL workflow. Airflow's powerful scheduling capabilities ensure that data pipelines run at specified intervals, enabling continuous and automated data processing. Its DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) structure allows for easy monitoring and management of the workflow, ensuring that each step in the ETL process is executed in the correct order.

## 5. Reporting and Visualization with Metabase

To make the data accessible and actionable, Metabase will be used for reporting and data visualization. Metabase's user-friendly interface allows for the creation of interactive dashboards and reports, providing valuable insights into the blockchain data. This will enable stakeholders to make informed decisions based on up-to-date and accurate information.

## 6. Dockerized Environment

The entire ETL pipeline will run in a Dockerized environment. Docker ensures consistency across different development and production environments, making it easy to deploy and manage the application. By containerizing the various components of the pipeline, we can ensure that the setup is portable, scalable, and resilient.
